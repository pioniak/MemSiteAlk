# Application Info
This app is a simple implementation of site displaying mems.
Mems are stored as a static array of objects with images via url to https://picsum.photos/

In this project I've used absolute path via configuring it by jsconfig.json
in VS Code change preferences to 
### `"javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "non-relative"`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
